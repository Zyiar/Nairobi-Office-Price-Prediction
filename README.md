# Nairobi Office Price Prediction

This project is a **simple linear regression model** developed to predict office prices based on office sizes in Nairobi. Using Python, we apply **Gradient Descent** to learn the best fit line and calculate **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as a performance measure.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: `Nairobi Office Price Ex.csv` - dataset with office size (`SIZE`) and price (`PRICE`).
- **Model**: Linear regression model using gradient descent.
- **Output**: Mean Squared Error for each epoch and a prediction of the office price for an office size of 100 sq. ft.
